# Computer-Systems

This is my coursework from CU Boulder CSCI 2400- Computer Systems, which I took in Fall 2019. All of these assignments are made to run in JupyterHub. 

Description of assignments:

Data Lab: Perform simple arithmetic and logical operations using bitwise operators.

Bomb Lab: Step through an executable program's assembly instructions in GDB to learn about the code's behavior and diffuse the binary bomb. 

Attack Lab: Exploit a buffer overflow bug to inject code and perform a return oriented attack.

Performance Lab: Uses loop unrolling, code refactoring and parallelism to improve an image filter program by a factor of 40.

Shell Lab:  A simple shell program which manages processes for the user.
